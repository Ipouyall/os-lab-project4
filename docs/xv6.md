## how xv6 works
### how can ```xv6``` get inout to the console?
```xv6``` uses ```uart``` to get input from console and send output to console.
### how can ```xv6``` get input from keyboard?
```xv6``` uses ```ps2``` to get input from keyboard and mouse.
### how input struct help?
```xv6``` uses ```input struct``` to get input from keyboard and mouse.
when user enter a character, ```input.e``` increases by one and ```input.buf``` stores the character.
after entering ```enter``` or ```Ctrl + D```or entering more than ```INPUT_BUF``` characters, 
```input.w``` gets equal to ```input.e```. then ```input.r``` starts to increasing until it gets equal to ```input.w```.
- ```input.r``` is the index of the first character in ```input.buf``` that is not read yet.
- ```input.w``` is the index of the first character in ```input.buf``` that is not written yet.
- ```input.e``` is the index of the first character in ```input.buf``` that is not entered yet.
- ```input.buf``` is the buffer that stores the characters that are entered by user.
